To compare name to capital to search for capitals containing country name need to concat the wildcards on whichever side desired since '%name%' is attempting to pass "name" as the variable

SELECT name, REPLACE(capital,name,'') as ext
FROM world
WHERE capital LIKE concat('%',name,'%') AND capital <> name

Search on character length. I.e. search of a country that has 2 o's separated by 2 characters
SELECT name FROM world
 WHERE name LIKE '%o__o%'

search at end of string or start of string using %a for example for end or a% for start

negative rounding in sql will let you round to hundreds (6766 -> 6800) for instance
